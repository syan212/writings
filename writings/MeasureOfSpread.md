## Introduction: What is a measure of spread?
To simply say, a measure of spread is a way of quantifying the range and deviance of the given data, and can range from relatively simple ideas (like the range) to more complicated ones that can more accurately describe the spread of the data.

## Range
The range is often the first measure of spread that a young child encounters in their mathematical journey, as it's extremely easy to understand and calculate. However, it is not an extremely accurate measure at all, as even a single extreme outlier can dramatically change the result. The range is the difference of the 0th and 100th percentile, or as it's usually phrased in school, the ```largest number minus the smallest number``` .

## Interquartile range
The interquartile range is another measure of spread that is taught relatively early, usually during introductory classes to data analysis or similar. It more accurately reflects the spread of the data than the range, as a small amount of outliers does not change it too much. It is also often used in professional contexts, as opposed to the range, such as defining outliers. It is defined as the difference of the 75th and 25th percentile.

## Standard deviation
The standard deviation is a measure of spread, often used on data sets that follow a standard distribution. It is used much more in professional contexts that the other two, as many real world data sets follow the normal distribution. Its definition is more complicated that the other two, and is the square root of the sum of all the elements minus the mean, all divided by the number of elements. This might leave some ambiguity, so feel free to research beyond this human essay.

## Conclusion
I love maths.
